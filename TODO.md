# TODO

include ensemble model -- there are a bunch of different ensemble models, which ones do we want to include?

- [x] todo, without wbtot's

- [x] w/o anything below wbtot's

- [x] add cohort

- [x] include xgboost or other boost models

- [x] do some venn diagrams (yay), choose top 20 for now

- [x] plot the same beta values identified in feature selection

- [x] get performance metrics (R2, MAE, RMSE, etc.) 

- [x] inlcude these metrics in the testing and training data, compare them to one another

include perarson / spearman correlation between taxa if there is significant correlation (heatmap of clr / ra data)

- [x] include just the latent factors in the model to se

# 20241202

- correlation heatmap of the top 20 features between ridge, enet, lasso (future directions?)
- do analysis again with only microbial information (compare directly to with clincial and w/o)
- summary of work, plots showing testing set results by R^2 for each method for species, pathways, etc (compare across methods and datasets)
- alpine folder - link to github, explain and walkthrough of analysis and output
